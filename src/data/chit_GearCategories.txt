# IMPORTANT NOTE: CHANGES TO THIS FILE WILL PROBABLY NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL YOU RELAUNCH MAFIA
# Using a very large tab width is recommended for viewing this file
# Category Name is used in chit.gear.display.in-run and chit.gear.display.aftercore
# Multiple lines can have the same category name as long as they have different numeric modifiers
# Numeric Modifiers are anything that works as an argument to numeric_modifier, see http://wiki.kolmafia.us/index.php?title=Modifiers
# The Numeric Modifiers section is a comma separated list of these modifiers, with an optional multiplier in front
# You can also have a lone number as a default score. This could be useful for purely boolean categories like melties, or for setting a threshold with a negative number
# Attributes is a comma separated list of the following in the format of AttributeName: Value, AttributeName2: Value2 etc
# You can have the same attribute multiple times with different arguments, although with some of them that might just make the category completely empty...
# Attributes with a boolean argument mean that those items will not be displayed unless that situation is either true or false, depending on the argument

# Attribute Name	Arguments
# IsTrue	Any boolean modifier, again see the wiki. It must be true for an item to be listed
# PvP	Boolean: The hippy stone is smashed
# Drunk	Boolean: The player is overdrunk
# Mainstat	Any stats, in the form of "Muscle" "Mysticality" or "Moxie" (case sensitive) can contain several, eg "Muscle or Moxie"
#	The way you phrase it is irrelevant as long as it contains the full name of all stats you want in the proper case
# Quest	Any argument to zlib's qprop function
# Bounty	One of your current bounty targets contains this text
# Path	Only display if you are in a specific path
# Manual	If true, then the Numeric Modifiers list is instead treated as a list of items, rather than a list of modifiers. Items can be scored with multipliers.
# Force	If true, EVERYTHING in this section (even from other lines, EVERYTHING with that section name) will display regardless of user settings
